## Description :pen:

The Employee CLI allows employess to enter information that will be rendered to HMTL. It's similar to an employee directory.

How to use the application:

- Run the application
- Fill out the answers to the questions
- Select Finished when you've completed the questions
- The application takes care of everything else creating an HMTL file with the employee information



## Challenges :ocean:

 - Making sure I had all the necessary functions to execute the application. 

 - A lot of debugging/clean-up errors took a long time to wrap up

 - The application doesn't display correctly. All user have to enter there information before selecting "Finshed" so all of the can be displayed. *I mentioned this in the video demo*
